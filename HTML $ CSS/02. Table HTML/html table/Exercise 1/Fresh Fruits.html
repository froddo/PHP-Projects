				<td>Central Coast Organic Meyer Lemons are a rare treat.
					The skin is soft, orange in color and wonderful used for lemon zest.
					Gourmet chefs appreciate the unique Meyer lemon flavor for its extraordinary sweetness.
					Meyer Lemons were developed by crossing lemon with tangerine or sweet orange.
					The result is a lemon that is really special.
					Our farm has been in business since 1998 and we have followed organic and sustainable farming practices such as mulching,
					cover crops, beneficial insects and drip irrigation.
					We offer Meyer Lemons in 10 lb. and 7lb. boxes shipped via priority mail anywhere in the U.S.Meyer lemons are a rare treat.
					Those that are grown on the Central Coast are even sweeter and juicier due to our special climate.</td>
