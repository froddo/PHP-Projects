Quadratic equation

Write a script that reads the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 and solves it (prints its real roots).
Calculates and prints its real roots.
Note: Quadratic equations may have 0, 1 or 2 real roots.

Examples:

a	b	c	roots
2	5	-3	x1=-3; x2=0.5
-1	3	0	x1=3; x2=0
-0.5	4	-8	x1=x2=4
5	2	8	no real roots
