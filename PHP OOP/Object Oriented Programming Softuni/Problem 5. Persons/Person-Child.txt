Define a class Person that has name, age and email. The name and age are mandatory. The email is optional. Define
properties that accept non-empty name and age in the range [1...100]. In case of invalid argument, throw an
exception. Define a property for the email that accepts either null or non-empty string containing '@'. Define two
constructors. The first constructor should take name, age and email. The second constructor should take name and
age only and call the first constructor. Implement the ToString() method to enable printing persons.
